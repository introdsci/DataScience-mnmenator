## Introduction

The purpose of this section is to review and revise the previous sections to address peer and instructor review as well as to discuss future directions of this project, including the implications of the insights and how to operationalize the work.

## Revisions: Part 1

1. Provided additional numerical proof alongside the graph that indicates that the higher seeded players wins roughly 2/3 of the time. The following line of code was added for this purpose:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sum(match$winner_seed<match$loser_seed)/nrow(match)
```

2. Changed the formatting of the variable list for easier readability.

3. Included links to every other page for easier navigation.

4. Made graphs more aesthetically pleasing with added color and adjusted legend titles.

## Operationalization (or lack thereof)

The insights from this project seem to indicate that operationalization is either not necessary or not really possible.

Part 1 showed that while the current seeding system is not perfect, it is certainly good enough, so there is no real need to pursue any sort of change to the system.

The predictions from Part 2 have to do with post-game stats and while some of the conclusions are interesting, they don't indicate a necessity or avenue for change.
