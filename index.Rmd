## Abstract

In tennis, "seeding" is the act of ensuring that the players who are most likely to win a tournament will not face each other early on. A player's seed is determined by their ranking as well as their recent performance. In an algorithmically ideal world, a higher seeded player should always beat a lower seeded player. This is obviously not the case in the real world, as the seeding system cannot not account for all variables, like favorable matchups or whether or not a player is having a bad day. But just how accurate is the seeding system? That is what this project will attempt to find out.
